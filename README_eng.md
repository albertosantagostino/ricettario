# Recipes collection

**The bad news**
If you are interested in this collection of recipes and you want to navigate around, I'm sorry but I will not translate all these recipes to English, it's too much work and I don't think a lot of not-italian people will stumble on this specific repository

**The good news**
On the other hand, I'm writing these recipes in the most "plain" italian possible (no regionalisms, avoiding uncommon words). In this way it should be possible to translate them in a comprehensible form using an automatic translator
