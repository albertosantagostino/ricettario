# Recipes collection

**The bad news**  
If you are interested in this collection of recipes and you want to navigate around, I'm sorry but I will not translate it to English, it's too much work and I don't think many non-Italian speaker will stumble on this specific repository

**The good news**  
On the other hand, I'm writing these recipes in the most "plain" Italian possible (no regionalisms, avoiding uncommon words). In this way it should be possible to translate them in a comprehensible form using a translator service, like:
